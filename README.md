# douglas the self driving go-kart
My high school gives seniors the option to undergo a large project instead of taking classes for the last month of school. I had the idea to outfit a go-kart with self-driving functionality and roped some friends in to build it with me. We started with a bare-bones gas powered go-kart and added motors so we could programatically control the steering, accelerating, and breaking. Then, we outfitted the kart with a camera and software to view street lines and hooked everything up to a Raspberry Pi 3. In the end, we had somewhat promising results but lacked any time to polish the steering algorithm.
